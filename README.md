# Github Plugin - Image Slider Plugin
This is simple Image Slider plugin.Here are the ideals and core features I wanted to include:
* Extremely simple to setup (no dependencies)
* Very extensible
* Open source (goes without saying)

And, as an example, here are some features that should be there:
* Bullet navigation
* Full screen slider
* Provide with the shortcodes.
* Drag And Drop Image Position

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire **slider-plugin** folder to the **/wp-content/plugins/** directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** menu in WordPress admin.
3. Create new gallery, Use **[myslideshow  id="10"]** shortcode to publish your image slider into any page or post.
